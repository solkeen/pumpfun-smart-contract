### Introduction of Pump Fun
Pump.fun enables effortless creation and trading of memecoins. It operates on a bonding curve model, where token prices are determined by the curve's shape. As more tokens are bought, the price increases, and as tokens are sold, the price decreases.

### Raydium Integration
When bonding curve hit 69K market cap , the liquidity of the pumpfun goes to solana dex such as raydium or meteora.
In this project , I forked pumpfun smart contract and made the integration part with raydium
